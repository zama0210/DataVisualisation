            A Critical Reflection of My Data-Driven Art
          </h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            In this blog post, I will reflect on implementing a data-driven
            artwork for my website. This reflection will critically assess the
            representation and communication strategies I employed in the
            artwork.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Before defining any objectives, I had to start with understanding
            what a data-driven artwork entails. I began by simply googling the
            definition of it. This definition would help me with understanding
            how I would approach the artwork and it would be at the forefront of
            the journey to understanding. That difficulty posed a challenge for
            how I would plan the artwork. I was not receiving anything useful or
            what I was looking for was said in a roundabout way (there was a
            struggle to form a clear understanding of what data-driven artwork
            is).
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Thankfully, the consultation with a tutor prompted me to a broader
            understanding of what was required of me. That is when I started
            thinking about what message I wanted to convey concerning the CME
            API.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Together with the examples I was provided in the consultation, I
            re-analysed the data the API presented, and I picked the dataset
            that I found to be useful for the artwork. I wanted to create an
            artwork with a map of the world. This map would be made up of
            pulsating circles that form the countries of the world. The data
            would show where the CMEs have happened. Early into the development
            of this map, I realised that unless I had an abundance of data from
            this API, which I realised that it would become increasingly hard to
            implement the artwork as I wanted seeing as my static data was not
            rendering the abundance of data that I needed it to.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            I started approaching the artwork differently, completely abandoning
            the whole map approach. I still wanted the objective to remain the
            same, but I thought of creating an image of an actual Coronal Mass
            Ejection with the data in the circles. I started by looking at
            images of the coronal mass ejections and ensuring that they were
            usable at the very least.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            The identification of the data not being enough for the artwork
            severely worried me and it made me doubt and delay the
            implementation of this second idea. I liked the idea because I had
            only two pictures throughout my website of the Coronal Mass
            Ejections and I thought that even if I were to be unable to create a
            map of CMEs, I at least wanted my viewers to gain a better
            perspective of CMEs whilst still offering information about CMEs.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            I also wanted to make the jargon associated with CMEs broken down,
            as well as have the dataset be explained creatively to ensure the
            user engagement remains the same throughout the website.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            However, I was struggling to push for a new perspective on this
            artwork, so I referred to the reading “Artistic Data Visualization:
            Beyond Visual Analytics” by Fernanda B. Viégas and Martin
            Wattenberg. I was not looking for anything specific, but I thought
            that the reading would be a great tool to help with brainstorming an
            artwork appropriate for the objectives I had laid out.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            It became clear that I needed to recalibrate and redefine what I
            thought of the chosen API. “A second point is that our definition
            avoids the issue of beauty: we do not contend that beautiful
            scientific visualizations are automatically artistic, or that
            visualization art must be pretty” (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007).
            This statement was a godsend because I realised that I was trying to
            make it aesthetically pleasing first before making it functional. It
            became evident when I returned to the plans, I had for the data art
            and the pictures I downloaded as examples.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            I started over this time with a fresher mind. I looked at the ideas
            I had before, and I started critiquing them. I asked myself
            questions like, “Why did I think it would work with the CME API?”,
            “What did I like about the idea?”, “Why did I like the idea” and
            “How could I have made it better?”. Answering those questions and
            identifying what was common among these ideas.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            I realised that I preferred to show the data that I wanted to
            display without physically telling the user what the artwork was
            displaying (showing rather than telling) but I wanted to create
            something fun and creative without severely affecting how the art
            would be rendered by the data.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Overall, I believe I tried my best to implement the data art and to
            convey the data I had been working with throughout the semester in
            the best way possible by considering various factors that could
            jeopardise meeting the assigned requirements as well as maintaining
            a consistent aesthetic.
