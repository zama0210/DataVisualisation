            Data Visualisation, Art, and Representation
          </h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            When it comes to representing data in visual forms, two popular
            methods often come to mind: data visualization and data art. While
            they may seem similar at first glance, these two techniques have
            unique purposes and approaches to representation. In this essay, we
            will delve into the readings to examine the relationship between
            data visualization, data art, and their strategies for representing
            information.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Data visualization is a presentation of data in a graphical or
            visual format. A data visualization tool is responsible for the
            visual representations of this data, an example of this is Tableau
            or D3.js. It offers an intuitive way of analysing data
            interactively, in turn, it helps users identify patterns,
            hypothesize correlations and causations, and offers support to the
            act of sense-making.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Data visualization also offers the opportunity to understand data,
            as well as draw conclusions at first glance. Some examples of data
            visualization include bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots and line
            graphs.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Data art, however, is not just about presenting data in a visually
            appealing manner. It goes beyond that and aims to captivate and
            engage the audience. Breaking away from traditional methods of data
            representation encourages viewers to think critically and engage
            with the data in a more meaningful way. Some notable examples of
            data visualization in the art and design world include Dear Data, a
            project that involved exchanging postcards with hand-drawn data
            visualizations depicting personal experiences, and Wind Map, an
            animated visualization of wind patterns in the US using lines and
            curves. These projects showcase the potential of data art to evoke
            emotions and spark curiosity in its viewers.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Both data visualisation and data art offer complexity when it comes
            to the representation of data. It is important to identify the
            strategies of representation to be able to discuss the relationship
            between representation, data art and data visualization.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Data visualization and art differ in their strategies of
            representation in two ways:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The main goals and objectives of data visualization and data art
              diverge in their approach. While data visualization strives to
              simplify and clarify complex data, its main purpose is to convey
              important insights and conclusions from data analysis to assist in
              decision-making. It is all about presenting information in a
              visually appealing and comprehensible way, weaving together
              numbers and figures to tell a compelling story and captivate the
              audience. On the other hand, data art serves a different purpose
              altogether - one of artistic expression rather than practical
              utility. Its main aim is to entertain and evoke an aesthetic
              experience, utilizing intricate arrangements of shapes and colours
              to engage the audience and evoke powerful emotions.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Data art is a unique form of artistic expression that defies
              traditional norms and pushes boundaries. Its purpose is to
              transform raw data into captivating visual representations,
              utilizing specialized tools and software. By doing so, it aims to
              evoke emotion and imagination in its audience. Unlike traditional
              data visualization, which adheres to strict guidelines, data art
              takes a more creative and unconventional approach. It utilizes
              basic visual elements like lines, shapes, colours, and quantity,
              and incorporates Gestalt principles to tell compelling stories
              through simplicity, proximity, similarity, continuity, and
              closure. Through this, data art delivers meaningful insights and
              findings in a visually stunning and thought-provoking manner

            "Artistic Data Visualisation: Beyond Visual Analytics" by Fernanda
            B. Viégas and Martin Wattenberg (2007) delves into the fascinating
            world of artistic visualization. Through their thought-provoking
            insights, they shed light on how data can be transformed into a
            beautiful and meaningful form of art. As they explore the concept,
            the authors highlight the artist's intention to use data as a medium
            for their artistic expression, and the complex nature of defining
            both artistic visualization and art.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            When it comes to artistic representation and data art, the
            techniques used share many similarities. Both rely on visual aids
            such as charts, graphs, and maps to convey information. However,
            data art takes things a step further by using data visualization as
            a means of creating art. This unique approach offers a fresh
            perspective on the endless possibilities of expressing creativity
            through visualizing data. As previously mentioned, it truly blurs
            the lines between art and data.

            In her essay "How Art Can Contribute to Ethical Reflection on Risky
            Technologies" (2016), Sabine Roeser delves into the central idea
            that art has the power to spark ethical reflection when it explores
            and interacts with risky technologies. By evoking emotions,
            translating abstract issues into tangible forms, delving into
            uncharted possibilities, pushing the boundaries of our imagination,
            and expanding our narrow personal views, art can catalyze ethical
            reflection. This idea not only applies to the realm of art focused
            on risky technologies but can also be applied to data art and data
            visualization in a more general sense. As mentioned in the
            respective definitions, the objective is to elicit engagement and
            this is usually done by evoking emotions, and hypotheses, concluding
            and enabling the viewers to critically think about the data that is
            presented to them.

            In his work, Stuart Hall (1997) outlines the constructionist
            approach to representation, which encompasses two key methods: the
            semiotic approach and the discourse approach. According to Hall,
            representation is a crucial aspect of culture formation, as it
            enables us to describe and imagine the world around us through
            language and meaning. This concept can be likened to the idea of
            encoding and decoding, where encoding refers to the packaging of
            information (in this case, data presented to the audience), and
            decoding refers to how that information is interpreted by the
            audience. This approach places a strong emphasis on the role of
            language and symbols in constructing and conveying meaning, as well
            as the process of transforming pre-existing concepts into forms that
            can be understood and experienced by the audience.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            The constructionist approach acknowledges that “neither things in
            themselves nor the individual users of language can fix meaning in
            language. Things don’t mean: we construct meaning, using
            representational systems- concepts and signs” (Hall, 1997, p.25).
            What consists of a representation system is the sounds we make,
            images, marks made on a canvas and digital impulses transmitted
            electronically (Hall,1997, p. 25).
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            As discussed in chapter one of Jenny Kidd’s book, ‘Representation’,
            “semiotics rests on an understanding that the words, languages and
            other signs which we use in our everyday and social context help to
            shape our reality” (2015). This is where the importance of
            representation in data lies. Before you can engage with data art
            without additional assistance in understanding the data, it is
            important to engage with traditional data visualizations, as data
            visualizations are now crucial to news media, papers, periodicals,
            on television and the internet. Such forms bring together images,
            symbols, tabular and graphical content and text in order to tell
            stories that have origins in data” (Kidd, 2015). Audiences are
            dependent on context before they can interact with data art. This
            context could be presented in a paragraph or it can be substantiated
            with a graph. ‘House of Cards’, by Aaron Koblin created with
            director James Frost is an excellent example of data art that would
            be in dire need of context before audiences can engage with it.
            ‘House of Cards’ is a three-dimensional data-driven music video that
            uses Lidar lasers and structured light scanners to scan the band
            Radiohead. Though this data art is expressed as a music video, there
            is no initial meaning produced to it, unless of course the person
            viewing the music video is a fan of Radiohead. It would have been
            preferred if the creators of this artwork explained how the data was
            captured to animate the band’s movements as well as the process of
            syncing the movements made by the artwork to the music, the meaning
            produced can be extended to people who observe data as well as to
            the general public. I believe that the suggestion would have
            influenced the audience to engage further with the artwork, aside
            from the artwork sparking curiosity.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            In conclusion, the exploration of data representation through the
            lenses of data visualization and data art reveals a diverse array of
            strategies, purposes, and impacts. While data visualization serves
            as a valuable tool for simplifying complex information and aiding
            decision-making through visually appealing and easy-to-understand
            presentations, data art takes a different approach. It aims to
            captivate and engage its audience on an emotional and aesthetic
            level, pushing the boundaries of traditional representation.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            However, the difference between data visualization and data art goes
            beyond their objectives. It also lies in their creative processes.
            Data visualization follows strict guidelines and principles to
            ensure clarity and simplicity, while data art embraces a more
            unconventional and artistic approach, using basic visual elements to
            convey deeper meanings in visually striking and thought-provoking
            ways.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            The ideas presented in "Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual
            Analytics" by Fernanda B. Viégas and Martin Wattenberg highlight the
            transformative power of data, blurring the lines between art and
            data representation. Additionally, Sabine Roeser's exploration of
            how art can spark ethical reflection and Stuart Hall's perspective
            on representation as a construction further emphasize the
            significant roles that both data art and data visualization play in
            shaping our understanding of the world and promoting critical
            thinking.
