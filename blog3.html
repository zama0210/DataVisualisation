          A Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation
        </h2>
        <p class="post-text">
          Welcome to the third instalment of the blog series. In this post, we
          will critically reflect on the reading, “What is the Interaction for
          Data Visualisation” by Evanthia Dimara and Charles Périn.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          The reading provides an overall analysis and demonstration of
          interactivity within data visualisation. The article follows a set of
          data collected by the authors about different articles made by other
          authors whilst they made observations regarding Human-Computer
          Interaction (HCI) as well as providing readers insight into the topic
          at hand, interaction for data visualisation.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          The article highlights the importance of interaction in data
          visualisation and the clear need for a definition of the term. The
          authors provide a comprehensive overview of the different perspectives
          on interaction in the visualisation community and HCI, which helps
          clarify the concept. One of the most notable things discussed under
          the frame of interaction was the importance of human-driven
          interaction with data, by the actions performed after seeing data.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          While reading this article, the following section provided a
          foundation for understanding how good interaction is made.<b
            >(a good majority of these will be quoted directly from the
            article):</b
          >
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          These concepts specify what formulates a good interaction.
          <b>Dialogue,</b> the first concept, is the most prominent from the
          early history of HCI. This concept looks at interaction as a cycle of
          communication (Dimara and Périn, 2020). “Interaction is channelled
          through input and output from a computer perspective, and through
          perception and action from a user perspective”. This quote provides a
          contextualised summary of what this concept entails.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Transmission</b> sees interaction as a transference of “information
          between the computer and the user”. As a rule of thumb for this
          concept, good interaction maximises the transmission rate. This is
          determined is through using the information theory which states that
          “the transmission rate is the amount of error-free information per
          time unit that is transferred over a communication channel in the
          presence of noise” (Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Control</b> is the third concept that sees interaction as a
          minimization of error concerning some user target. The control theory
          drives this concept. The theory states that “interaction is continuous
          and defined through a system that consists of goals, inputs, outputs,
          feedback, feedforward and states” (Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Tool Use</b> sees interaction “as a series of tools that allow a
          user to interact with a computer”. According to the activity theory
          and the instrumental interaction model, the tool is a mediator between
          an object of interest and the user(Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>
        <p class="post-text"></p>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Optimal Behaviour</b> utilises interaction as an adaptive behaviour
          under user capabilities, task, interface, and environmental
          constraints. “It is based on the rationality paradigm and adaptation
          theories such as information foraging that state that humans tend to
          approximate optimal adaptation of their motor, perceptual and
          cognitive processes” (Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Embodiment</b> sees interaction as the act of being and
          participating in the world, in which the users feel that the
          technology is an extension of them(Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Experience,</b> as the name suggests, sees interaction as a
          phenomenon shaped by user expectations, momentary reactions, and
          recall. It places human experience as a key factor in how interaction
          unfolds(Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          By integrating these concepts, the authors state that good interaction
          comes from maximising these concepts and applying the theories that
          accompany them to the interaction.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          The authors provide extensive examples of what they mean by the
          importance of human responses to the data by answering the question,
          "Is this an interaction for visualisation?” I will provide a few
          quotes that demonstrate the previous statement. Before providing these
          examples, they give a compact definition of interaction in this
          context.<i>
            “Interaction for visualization is the interplay between a person and
            a data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one
            action from the person and an interface reaction that is perceived
            as such” </i
          >(Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          The authors create a definition of interaction based on two
          assumptions: i)interactions with visualisations are a subset of
          interactions with interactive systems, and ii) interactions with
          interactive systems are a subset of interactions with people’s minds
          and environments.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          Following this definition, here are the examples provided by the
          authors :
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>“SCENARIO 1: </b>Joe is staring at a visualization without
          performing any action that is interpretable by the visualization. He
          is reasoning (mentally) about the visualized data. There are further
          (computer-initiated) animations and real-time changes that show
          important information that Joe considers in his reasoning process.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Answer: </b>No. While there were several actions from the person,
          the visualization did not return any reaction as a response to those
          actions.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>SCENARIO 2: </b>Joe wants to focus on a cluster of data points.
          Using a mouse, he traces a lasso to select the data points. The
          visualization draws the lasso with the same colour as the background.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Answer: </b> No. While there was an action reaction, the reaction
          of the system was not perceived by the person.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>SCENARIO 3: </b> Joe notices a slider widget. He intends to filter
          out some data points. He moves the slider, and the visualization is
          zoomed in. He does not understand what is going on.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Answer: </b>Yes. Because the reaction of the visualization
          (although not understood) was perceived by the person.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>SCENARIO 4: </b>An airport provides a visualization that updates
          automatically to show all departure gate data. Jack looks for his gate
          number, but the visualization changes too quickly. A gaze detector
          tracks Jack’s unfocused gaze attempts and slows down the rate at which
          the visualization changes. Jack now locates his gate number.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Answer: </b>Yes. There was an action-reaction perceived by the
          person. Such gazing action was not interpretable by the interface in
          scenario 1.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>SCENARIO 5: </b> Averell cannot remember where he parked his car.
          In the parking, a screen shows car CO2 emission data to motivate car
          drivers to use their cars less. Averell is not careful, and he bumps
          his head on the screen. Because the screen is touch-enabled, this
          contact rearranges the data points. Averell sees some graphics moving
          around but does not pay attention. He ignores the screen and continues
          his search.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b> Answer: </b>No. While there was an action-reaction perceived by
          the person, there was no data-related intent (unless the designer,
          having such intent, had caused Averell to non-consciously process some
          data).
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>SCENARIO 6: </b>Like Averell, William bumps his head on the
          display. But when he sees the graphics move around, he gets curious
          and starts touching the display to explore what these graphics things
          are about.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          <b>Answer: </b>Yes. Although the interaction was not initiated by an
          explicit intent, there was an implicit data-related intent involved in
          the process” (Dimara and Périn, 2020).
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          These scenarios helped me engage with the arguments the authors had at
          hand and I relied on these scenarios as a source of understanding of
          what interaction is and its role in data visualisation.
        </p>

        <p class="post-text">
          I believe that the authors would have missed the mark had they
          excluded these scenarios as well as the basic phrasing of their
          research, their formulas, how they conducted their research, how it
          was linked to interaction and how their research aided in providing a
          broader explanation to the question they are asking in the title.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">
          By separating the information into well-organised sections, the
          authors broke down their explanations and examples without
          compromising the necessary jargon or excluding important points to
          appeal to the general audience.
