            A Critical Reflection of my proposed UI and UX
          </h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            In this blog post I will be taking the opportunity to critically
            reflect on the UI and UX design of my website using resources to
            justify the decisions that I made in the construction of the
            website.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Before implementing any UI and UX principles I decided to search for
            examples of data visualization website so that I could take note of
            what was common amongst these websites. I had to consider that my
            website would have additional webpages and that it would have a
            greater focus on my academics. I started with a basic idea of what
            would be included in my navigation bar before starting with a few
            low-fidelity wireframes on a piece of paper.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            At this point, I was focused on the interface because I wanted to
            give myself an opportunity to do a thorough UX analysis.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Initially, I wanted the hero section to have a background image and
            the main colour for this image would be white so that when the user
            scrolls there’s no real change in the background, the change would
            happen with the body, with the text. Through trial and error, I
            decided that it would be better if I left the image out of the hero
            section. I chose to do the DONKI API for this assignment with the
            focus being on Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) so I wanted the Hero
            section to give a glimpse of what the data presented will be about.
            All images I could find of the related topic made the hero section
            jarring to open and it minimised the aesthetic I was trying to
            build. The images were screaming at you and the information in that
            section became hard to read.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            My overview section was intended to provide the user a SparkNotes
            version of what CMEs are and how they are measured so when the user
            navigates to the visualisation page, they would have a basic
            understanding what they will be looking at. An overview section was
            what was missing from the example website I chose to look at. At
            various points, I would click the link to the website, and I would
            sit in confusion to what I was looking at and how this data had been
            collected.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I wanted the provided information to be in an asymmetrical balance
            with an accompanying picture and I intended for a large separation
            between paragraphs so that it would be easier to digest. This
            section of the homepage is where I believe I failed at maintaining a
            clean and simple design. The end product was cluttered.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            The blog needed to look different to the rest of the website because
            I wanted there to be a separation between it and the rest of the
            site. Blogs are websites so incorporating it as a webpage instead of
            its own website, took away the simplicity I was looking for. I
            considered reusing the structure from the previous submission, but I
            decided against it and used “A crash course on User Experience +
            Interface Design” pdf to jog my memory and I kept Fitt’s law at the
            forefront of my mind when I was designing how the cards would look.
            I decided against have a “Read More” button on the card as it
            created clutter in the previous submission, and I wanted to avoid
            it. I wanted to make sure that the actual posts were legible. I
            wanted to have an edged alignment for the posts, but I did not want
            the text to create a busy aesthetic. I also settled on having the
            references next to the post as opposed to the end of the post, but I
            realise now that it makes the post harder to reader and it takes
            away from my initial intentions.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            In my style guide, I ensured to put the colour scheme and the chosen
            typography for the hierarchical headings as well as the paragraphs.
            I opted out of implementing a grid system (though I understood that
            it would maintain a consistent layout) because the content on each
            webpage would be vastly different. I tried my best to ensure
            consistency with the above-mentioned categories instead of a layout
            because I did not think it would fit well, considering the
            requirements for the website. My previous assignment submission was
            used as a point of reflection and as a way to see how I could
            strengthen the weaknesses I had at that time.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Moving forward, I plan on improving the interface of the blog,
            ensuring that all my images display even after I have submitted the
            assignment and that I make some tweaks with the responsive interface
            because I viewed my website on my phone, and I have grown to dislike
            how the interface looks there in comparison to on my laptop.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Reflecting on the design decisions I have made has been an
            enlightening process. I have used the provided UX and UI guide as
            the main assistants in the construction of this website and I will
            continue to refer to these guides to ensure I do not reflect again
            and find myself with the same grievances as I have had before. I am
            confident that the end-product will be exceptional.
