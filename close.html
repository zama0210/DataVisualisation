      <h2 class="sub-heading">A Critical Reflection of Data Visualization</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        In this blog post, I will be providing analysis and a breakdown of data
        visualisation with the use of the reading,
        <b>Overview of Data Visualisation by Li Qi</b>. Using this reading and
        my personal understanding of the contents of the reading, I hope to
        impart a better understanding of the subject matter.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Data visualisation has a multitude of definitions in the reading, with
        each definition varying from the next. In my own understanding, Data
        Visualisation is data that is presented in a manner that is digestible,
        easy to understand and has grouped data together on the basis of a
        category. It is usually shown graphically or through imagery.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        This is the definition that aligned with my definition in the reading,
        “Data visualisation is the presentation of data in a pictorial or
        graphical format, and a data visualisation tool is the software that
        generates this presentation. Data Visualisation provides users with
        intuitive means to interactively explore and analyze data, enabling them
        to effectively identify increasing patterns, infer correlations and
        causalities, and support sense-making activities” (Bikakis 2018, cited
        in Li 2020, p. 19).
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Though this is a working definition, in comparison to the other provided
        definitions, it is quite verbose. Luckily, this was only at the
        beginning of the reading, and I had the resources to find a better
        understanding (for myself) before I continued further. “Data
        visualization is the graphical representation of information and data.
        By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data
        visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand
        trends, outliers, and patterns in data.” (Tableau, 2023). This
        definition is the same as the above definition, but the choice of
        vocabulary led me to understand the content better.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        From there on, it is appropriate to speak about the various advantages
        of data visualisation, the different types of visualization tools and
        the sub-fields data visualization can be categorised into.
      </p>

      <p class="post-text">The advantages of data visualisation are as follows:<br/>
        <ol>
        <li>It can represent a vast amount of data immediately.</li><br/>
        <li>Viewers are able to formulate new insights by "identifying emerging properties" (Li, 2020).</li><br/>
        <li>It can be used for product quality control where problems can be immediately identified through data analysis (Li, 2020).</li><br/>
    </ol>
  </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The reading then goes to introduce the sub-fields that data
        visualisation can be categorised into, information visualisation and
        scientific visualisation. Information visualisation is used to visually
        represent abstract data (Card, Mackinlay, & Schneiderman, 1999; Spence,
        2007, cited by Li 2020, p. 19) while scientific visualization is used to
        visually represent scientific data (Spence 2007, cited by Li 2020, p.
        19). So then, what is data?
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        “Data usually refers to raw, unprocessed information that is not
        recognized as having any meaning.” (Li, 2020) I was taught that data
        stems from the IOP (Input, Output, Processing) model. With it being a
        part of the processing aspect. But that was in relation to computers. I
        never separated what I had been taught about the model and the
        definition I received from the reading. I was taught that data has a lot
        of meaning and while yes, the visualisation tools provide a better
        insight of how we should interpret data, it never moved beyond that
        point.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Under the title ‘2.1.3 The Forms of Traditional Data Visualisation’,
        tables 2.1 and 2.2 gave an understanding of all the jargon I’d been
        reading for the last few pages. The common forms of data visualisations
        answered the questions I had.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The reading then goes on to list the data visualisation tools and
        provide a lengthy explanation for all 10 of them. These are the
        sentences that I found interesting in these explanations (these
        sentences will all be directly quoted from the reading):<br />
        <ol>
          <li>“Traditionally in a table columns are used to represent dimensions or fields, and rows represent the actual data.” (Li, 2020)</li><br/>
          <li>“Traditionally, charts represent data in the form of a table, graph, or diagram.” (Li, 2020)</li><br/>
          <li>“The visual metaphor of the tree is often used to represent a network of nodes that consists of root nodes and subordinate note within its branched schema in the field of data visualization.” (Li, 2020)</li><br/>
          <li>“A map is considered as a graphical depiction highlighting relationships between elements of space (objects or regions).” (Li, 2020)</li><br/>
          <li>“It is a very useful form when multivariate data is presented with x or y coordinates.” (Cleveland 1993, cited in Li 2020, p. 28)</li><br/>
          <li>“A diagram can be used in business-system analysis that consists of rectangles and lines illustrating information flow.” (Li, 2020)</li><br/>
          <li>“A graph may not present accuracy of data; however, it can provide the insight of data.” (Li, 2020)</li><br/>
          <li>A simulation “enables viewers to understand and describe natural phenomena such as weather changes or the role of dark energy in the universe.” (Ahrens et al. 2010, cited in Li 2020, p. 28)</li><br/>
          <li>“Waveform is a common form that is used in visual representation of the form of a signal, which refers to the shape of the time related to various quantities of data.” (Li, 2020)</li><br/>
          <li>Volume “creates graphical representation of data set defined on 3D grids.” (Li, 2020)</li>

    
          
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        In general, the examples provided under the different data visualisation
        tools helped me move away from the traditional mindset of what a
        representation of data is. It was mostly through the lens of maths. When
        I saw the flight paths in Figure 2.5, I had a light bulb moment. I never
        understood why Scatter Plots were important nor did I care to learn how
        to effectively jot down data, but this figure gave me a different
        perspective. What I do not consider as a data visualisation tool
        probably is a part of the category.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The thinking surrounded by data visualisation is quite different to what
        the reading is presenting. All these images and examples break away from
        what is considered data visualisation by someone who isn’t familiar with
        collecting, processing, and storing data. After reading this reading I
        thought about the content that was shown in class (the International
        Space Station location website) and other content I consumed in my
        personal time, and I immediately gained a broader understanding of data
        visualisation.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        This reading has shown me the understanding of data visualisation and it
        has shown a different approach I could take to visualise collected data.
